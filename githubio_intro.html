<h2>Angelina Zhen SWEN-101 GitHub.io Introduction
</h2>
<p>My name is Angelina Zhen. I am from Staten Island, New York. I attended Midwood Highschool. My hobbies include baking, hanging out with friends, and drawing. Some of my favorite foods are cookies, ice cream, churros, satsumaimo, and sausage congee. I prefer sweet over salty. My favorite color is yellow, but I also like purple. A fun fact about me is that I was born on 7/19 at 7:19 exactly.
